  - Improving state change detection and batching
  - Implementing reactive state tracking
  - Adding parent-child communication patterns
  - **Files working on**: 
    - `orbit/src/component/tree.rs`
    - `orbit/src/component/lifecycle.rs`
    - `orbit/src/component/update_scheduler.rs`

## Coordination Guidelines

- **Pull before starting work each day**
- **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
- **Create separate branches** for features
- **Review each other's PRs** before merging
- **Update this file** when starting new tasks

## Daily Check-in

### May 26, 2025
- Dev1: Working on component tree management and lifecycle integration
- Dev2: TBD

## Integration Points

- Component tree manager needs to integrate with rendering pipeline through the `update_scheduler.rs`
- Layout system should integrate with component model through the `ComponentTree` interface
- State changes must trigger rendering through a consistent event system
