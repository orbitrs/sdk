Orbitrs SDK is a workspace containing the core Orbit UI framework, CLI tooling, static analysis tools, public assets, and comprehensive documentation to power Rust-first UI across web, desktop, native, and embedded targets.

## Development Priority

> **Important**: The SDK itself is currently used for personal development purposes and improvements to it are considered non-essential. The primary focus is on core framework development. Contributors should prioritize work on the core components (orbit, orbiton, orlint) rather than SDK enhancements.

## Recent Progress (May 2025)

- Fixed build target conflicts in examples project structure
- Created comprehensive examples demonstrating props and events system
- Implemented component lifecycle demonstration
- Added WGPU renderer examples for 3D capabilities
- Refactored project organization for better maintainability

See [Milestone 1 Tracking](docs/roadmap/tracking/milestone-1-tracking.md) for detailed progress updates.
